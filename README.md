# 💼 SmartFinancial AI

SmartFinancial AI is a modern financial dashboard and assistant that helps users analyze stocks, visualize trends, and lays the foundation for intelligent investment recommendations using real-time data, Python analytics, and a conversational interface.

---

## 🧠 Project Vision
The goal of SmartFinancial AI is to build a system that:
- 📈 Predicts stock prices using deep learning models *(future)*
- 📰 Gathers real-time financial news and ratios *(future)*
- 🧾 Explains predictions with reasoning *(future)*
- 💬 Acts as a chatbot for investment queries *(future)*
- 📊 Recommends actions (Buy/Sell/Hold) *(future)*

---

## 🔧 Current System Components

### 1. 🌐 Frontend (React)
- Search for any stock and view real-time quote data (via Twelve Data API)
- View a summary of major indices (via ETF proxies: SPY, DIA, QQQ)
- See a line graph of the last month’s price for any searched stock (generated by Python)
- Clean, modern UI with component-based design

### 2. 🖥️ Backend (Node.js + Express)
- REST API for stock quotes and graph images
- Integrates with Twelve Data API for real-time and historical data
- Runs a Python script to generate line graphs for any stock symbol
- Serves both JSON data and PNG images to the frontend

### 3. 🐍 Python Analytics
- Uses `yfinance` and `matplotlib` to fetch historical data and generate line graphs
- Designed to be extended for ML models (LSTM, XGBoost, etc.) in the future

---

## 🚀 Planned Features
- **Prediction Engine:** Integrate LSTM/XGBoost/ARIMA for 1–7 day price forecasts
- **LLM Reasoning Agent:** Use GPT-4 or similar to explain predictions, answer queries, and recommend actions
- **Memory Module:** Track prediction accuracy and learn from feedback
- **Conversational Chatbot:** Natural language interface for investment questions and recommendations
- **News & Sentiment:** Integrate financial news and sentiment analysis
